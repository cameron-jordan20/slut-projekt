    <h3>The Laws and Rules of the Internet</h3>

          The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new EU law which forces companies who operate websites to adhere to strict
          policies on the collection of user data; setting the same level of protection on IP adresses and cookies, as they would on
          name, address or social security number. However, this law is not as clear as one might desire, essentially leaving much
          of the regulation up for debate and interpretation, stating, for example, that companies should only collect a "reasonable"
          amount of user data.
        <br>
          As an individual user, this law is very beneficial because it disallows large tech companies from gathering large
          amounts of information on the individual, such as IP address and location, which can be used for tracking
          and scarily accurate advertising recommendations.
        <br>
          However, as a webite or tech company this law is not nearly as beneficial because personalized ad revenue is a large
          portion of tech companies income, as well as helping with location based personalization of the website; the
          wide interpretability of this law also harms companies, because the regulatory bodies can interpret the amount of
          data that is allowable to collect, and therefore charge companies in unfair case situations.

        <p>
          Upphovsrätt protects the works of art such as music, film and literature; and it should be noted that it is not necessary
          to seek out this protection, instead it is automatically awarded to any work of art that is published. However,
          the creator can also choose who has access to and can display copies of this work, as well as who can make use of this art,
          especially when it is published online.
        <br>
          As with the GDPR law, this is a law to protect the rights of internet users, and is therefore very beneficial for the
          individual. It means that any published work of art on the internet is protected, and can not be illegally replecated
          which helps to safeguard the rights and works of artists, as well as their livelihoods which are often made by way of
          art.
        <br>
          This law is almost universally beneficial and is difficult to see in a negative light, however some works, such as scientific works,
          are also protected under upphovsrätt which would mean that scientific advancement could theoretically be stalled,
          as the sharing and subsequent use of scientific discoveries would be hindered.

          LEK (Lag om Electroniskt Kommunikation) gives the right to secure and effecient electronic communication to everyone,
          as well as legally securing the right to the greatest number of selections possible within communication services and/or
          providers. The law states that this should be promoted through the encouragement of "competition and international harmonization,"
          however, there should be a universal option that always available to every individual. It should also be noted that, when applying
          this law, there should be special weight given to the important of electronic communication within freedom of speech
          and expression.
        <br>
          LEK is possibly the most relevant law surround the use, and/or rather the prohibition, of cookies. A cookie is a small text file
          which is saved on the users computer, and transmits some information to a server, in an effort to save passwords to a website
          or to personalize ads.
        <br>
          So far as benefits, it makes the use of websites easier, because the user does not have to remember their password or login information,
          however, this can be negative because cookies can track users. Due to the fact that LEK regulates cookies, it has an overall
          positive effect.
