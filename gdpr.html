          The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new EU law which forces companies who operate websites to adhere to strict
          policies on the collection of user data; setting the same level of protection on IP adresses and cookies, as they would on
          name, address or social security number. However, this law is not as clear as one might desire, essentially leaving much
          of the regulation up for debate and interpretation, stating, for example, that companies should only collect a "reasonable"
          amount of user data.

          Upphovsrätt protects the works of art such as music, film and literature; and it should be noted that it is not necessary
          to seek out this protection, instead it is automatically awarded to any work of art that is published. However,
          the creator can also choose who has access to and can display copies of this work, as well as who can make use of this art,
          especially when it is published online.

          LEK (Lag om Electroniskt Kommunikation) gives the right to secure and effecient electronic communication to everyone,
          as well as legally securing the right to the greatest number of selections possible within communication services and/or
          providers. The law states that this should be promoted through the encouragement of "competition and international harmonization,"
          however, there should be a universal option that always available to every individual. It should also be noted that, when applying
          this law, there should be special weight given to the important of electronic communication within freedom of speech
          and expression. <br />
